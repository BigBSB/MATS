Getting Started
===============

Set-Up
++++++

Code was orginally developed using the `Enthought Canopy python package distribution <https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/>`_.  However, further development will use `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_. Code is typically run using  `jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ (run in jupyter lab.  Any python package distribution should work with the code as long as the dependent packages are installed.


Main Packages
+++++++++++++

* `MATS <https://github.com/usnistgov/MATS>`_

* `HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI) <https://hitran.org/hapi/>`_   The version used in development is also available in the MATS repository.


Dependent Packages
++++++++++++++++++
This fitting program is not written as a basic package, meaning that there are several dependent packages that need to be installed and called to make the script work. 

There is commonly a delay in the most recent package release available in the enthought/anaconda package library and that available through pip install.  The following code will update to the newest release if the package is already installed.

.. code-block:: python

	python -m pip install --upgrade package_name --user

If the package is not installed then the following will install it.

.. code-block:: python

	pip install package_name

* `numpy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_ - python's fundamental scientific computing package
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ - python data structure package 
* `qgrid <https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid>`_ - provides interactive sorting, filtering, and editing of pandas dataframes in jupyter notebooks.  Make sure to follow the install instructions for both installation and jupyter installation or this won't work.  This is an optional package that allows for the :py:class:`MATS.Edit_Fit_Param_Files` to function.  
* os, sys - system variables
* `lmfit <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html>`_ - non-linear least-squares minimization and curve-fitting for python
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ - python plotting 
* `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_ - pretty plotting
* `scipy.fftpack <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/fftpack.html>`_ - provides fft functionality
* `jupyter lab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ - web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
